## Background

What are the factors associated with post-myocardial infarction (post-MI) mortality among patients admitted to hospitals in XX state?

### Description of the Dataset

The dataset consists of data from 1250 patients who experienced a myocardial infarction (MI) and were recruited from 7 different hospitals within a state. The dataset captures variables, with the goal of identifying risk factors associated with post-MI mortality.

**Risk Factor**

-   **ID:** ID of patient

-   **Hospital:** hospital to which the patient get admitted (1-7). Hospital 1 has no specialist, hospital 2-3 have general medicine specialist, and hospital 4-7 have cardiac specialist.

-   **Age (age):** Continuous variable representing the age of the patient in years.

-   **Sex (sex):** Categorical variable representing the sex of the patient (Female = 0, Male = 1).

-   **Diabetes Status (dm):** Binary variable indicating whether the patient has diabetes (Yes = 1, No = 0).

-   **Underlying Hypertension (hpt):** Binary variable indicating whether the patient has hypertension (Yes = 1, No = 0).

-   **Chronic Kidney Disease (ckd):** Binary variable indicating whether the patient has chronic kidney disease (Yes = 1, No = 0).

-   **Duration of Admission (dur_adm):** Continuous variable representing the length of hospital stay in days.

-   **Type of Treatments received (treatment):** Categorical variable indicating the types of treatments received at each hospital (invasive, noninvasive).

**Outcome variable**

-   **Post-MI Mortality:** Binary variable indicating the survival status of the patient at discharge (alive = 0, dead = 1).

Each **line** in each panel represents a **hospital** showing the change in **% post-MI mortality** between two levels of a independent variable.

The **lines don’t all go in the same direction** or have the same slope suggests there’s **variation in how each hospital’s mortality rates differ** by sex, treatment type, or comorbidities.

## Multivariate analysis (model building)

**Fixed effect and random effect**

Variable included in the model building : independent variable (age, sex, dm, ckd, treatment, dur_adm), outcome variable (status)

**Model building and Estimation**

### Binary logistic regression model

```{r}
mlog_model <- glm(status ~ age + sex + dm + ckd + treatment + dur_adm, family = binomial(link = 'logit'), data = data)
summary(mlog_model)
```

We have estimated the effect on predictors on the post-MI status using binary logistic regression model. However, there are one possible sources of **correlation** between observations in the data - on the study site (hospital).

A mixed model is justified in this analysis because the data exhibit a hierarchical structure, where patients are nested within hospitals. The plot shows variability in post-MI mortality across hospitals for different subgroups, suggesting that the effect of these predictors may not be uniform across all settings.

As subjects (level 1) are clustered within hospital (level 2) it may be necessary to consider a two-level random effects model when analyzing the data.

If you are interested in estimating the average effect of predictors on the outcome, you can proceed with **Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE)** - the marginal model.

### Marginal (population average) model

![](images/clipboard-3525049656.png)

```{r}
log_gee_model<- gee(status ~ age + sex +dm + ckd + treatment + dur_adm, id = hospital, 
                data = data, family = binomial(link = 'logit'), 
                corstr = "independence", 
                scale.fix = TRUE, scale.value = 1,
                maxiter = 100)
```

### Conditional model

#### Random intercept

random intercept (hospital)

![](images/clipboard-678614077.png)

```{r}
ri_lme <- glmer(status ~ age + sex + dm + ckd + treatment + dur_adm +
                        (1 | hospital), family = binomial, nAGQ = 20, 
                      data = data)
summary(ri_lme)
```

#### Random intercept with single random slope

Estimating the fixed effect of the risk factors while also controlling for random effect of duration of admission (slope) and hospital (intercept)

![](images/clipboard-182771819.png)

```{r}
rs_lme_dur <- glmer(status ~ age + sex + dm + ckd + dur_adm +
                        (1 + dur_adm| hospital), family = binomial("logit"), data = data, glmerControl(calc.derivs = FALSE))
summary(rs_lme_dur)
```

#### Random intercept with multiple random slope

Estimating the fixed effect of the risk factors while controlling for random effect of duration of admission (slope), treatment (slope), and hospital (intercept)

![](images/clipboard-421135473.png)

```{r}
rs_lme_dur_tx <- glmer(status ~ age + sex + dm + ckd + dur_adm + treatment +
                        (1 + dur_adm + treatment | hospital), family = binomial("logit"), data = data, glmerControl(calc.derivs = FALSE))
summary(rs_lme_dur_tx)
```

### Model comparison

We compare the AIC of binary logistic regression to random intercept model, random intercept with single random slope model, and random intercept with multiple random slopes model.

```{r}
models <- list(mlog_model, ri_lme, rs_lme_dur, rs_lme_dur_tx)
extract_aic <- function(model) {
  return(AIC(model))
}
aic_values <- sapply(models, extract_aic)

# Name the AIC values for easy identification
names(aic_values) <- c("mlog", "random intercept", "random intercept single slope", "random intercept multiple slope")

# Print the AIC values
print(aic_values)
```

The AIC of random effect model was lower than the binary logistic regression model, hence inclusion of random effect is justified.

compare random intercept to random intercept with single slope

```{r}
anova(ri_lme, rs_lme_dur, test = 'Chisq')
```

compare random intercept with single slope to random intercept with multiple slope

```{r}
anova(rs_lme_dur, rs_lme_dur_tx, test = 'Chisq')
```

The AIC of **random intercept with multiple random slope** model was significantly smaller than other random effect model, hence it is selected as the preliminary final model.

#### Estimate

preliminary final model

```{r}
rs_lme_dur_tx <- glmer(status ~ age + sex + dm + ckd + dur_adm + treatment +
                        (1 + dur_adm + treatment | hospital), family = binomial("logit"), data = data, glmerControl(calc.derivs = FALSE))
summary(rs_lme_dur_tx)
```

#### Inference

##### log odds

lets provide the 95% CI for the log odds estimated

```{r}
tidy(rs_lme_dur_tx, conf.int=T)
```

##### odds ratio

```{r}
tidy(rs_lme_dur_tx, exponentiate=T, conf.int=T)
```

##### random effects

lets extract the random effect along with the 95% CI

```{r}
tidy(rs_lme_dur_tx, effects = 'ran_vals',
     conf.int = TRUE)
```

#### Prediction

```{r}
head(predict(rs_lme_dur_tx, type = 'response'), 10)
```

predict the log odds for the first 10 observation

```{r}
head(predict(rs_lme_dur_tx, type = 'link'), 10)
```

## Model fitness

```{r}
plot(rs_lme_dur_tx, pch = 20, col = "black", lty = "dotted")
```

normality of residuals

```{r}
qqnorm(residuals(rs_lme_dur_tx))
```

```{r}
plot_model(rs_lme_dur_tx, type = 'diag')
```

AUROC

```{r}
library(pROC)
roc <- roc(response = data$status, predictor = fitted(rs_lme_dur_tx))
plot(roc)
auc(roc)
ci(roc)
```

```{r}
library(caret)
postMI <- factor(data$status, levels = c("0", "1"))

fit.m <- augment(rs_lme_dur_tx, type.predict = 'response') |>
           mutate(pred.class = factor(ifelse(.fitted > 0.5, '1', '0')))

fit.m$pred.class <- factor(fit.m$pred.class, levels = levels(postMI))

confusionMatrix(data = fit.m$pred.class, reference = postMI)

```

The model demonstrates strong predictive performance with an **accuracy** of 86.2% (95% CI: 84.2%, 88.0%), **sensitivity** of 93.8% and **specificity** of 66.4%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.88, 0.92) suggests excellent discriminative ability.

```

### Interpretation

We fitted a logistic mixed effect model (estimated using ML and Nelder-Mead optimizer) to predict post-MI mortality with age, sex, underlying diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, type of treatment, and duration of admission. The model included duration of admission, type of treatment, and admitted hospital as random effect. The model's total explanatory power is substantial (conditional R2 =0.67) and the part related to the fixed effects alone (marginal R2) is of 0.56.

***Fixed effect interpretation***

For each year increase in age, the odds of post-MI mortality increase by 1.18 (95% CI: 1.15, 1.21, p-value \<0.001), when adjusted for sex, underlying diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, duration of admission, treatment type, and random effect of hospital, treatment type and duration of admission.

Being male is associated with a 3.25 (95% CI: 2.16, 4.91, p-value \<0.001) increase in the odds of post-MI mortality compared to being female), when adjusted for age, underlying diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, duration of admission, treatment type, and random effect of hospital, treatment type and duration of admission.

Having diabetes mellitus is associated with a 2.99 (95% CI: 2.03, 4.39, p-value \<0.001) increase in the odds of post-MI mortality compared to not having diabetes mellitus, when adjusted for age, sex, chronic kidney disease, duration of admission, treatment type, and random effect of hospital, treatment type and duration of admission.

Having chronic kidney disease is associated with a 3.38 (95% CI: 2.33, 4.91, p-value \<0.001) increase in the odds of post-MI mortality compared to not having chronic kidney disease, when adjusted for age, sex, underlying diabetes mellitus, duration of admission, treatment type, and random effect of hospital, treatment type and duration of admission.

Receiving non-invasive treatment for myocardial infarction is associated with a 4.28 (95% CI: 0.40, 46.37, p-value = 0.023) increase in the odds of post-MI mortality compared to receiving invasive treatment, when adjusted for age, sex, underlying diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, duration of admission, and random effect of hospital, treatment type and duration of admission.

For each day increase in duration of admission, the odds of post-MI mortality increase by 1.29 (95% CI: 1.17. 1.43, p-value \<0.001), when adjusted for age, sex, underlying diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, treatment type, and random effect of hospital, treatment type and duration of admission.

***Random effect interpretation***

There was substantial variation in baseline post-MI mortality across hospitals (variance = 4.60, SD = 2.15), even after adjusting for patient-level factors.

The effect of admission duration on mortality varied slightly between hospitals (variance = 0.013, SD = 0.12), while the effect of treatment type (invasive vs. non-invasive) showed larger differences across hospitals (variance = 5.89, SD = 2.43).

There was a moderate negative correlation between hospital baseline mortality and the effect of admission duration (-0.44), and a strong negative correlation with the effect of treatment (-1.00), suggesting that hospitals with higher baseline mortality showed smaller effects of duration and greater variation in treatment outcomes.

Hospitals with cardiac specialists (4-7) generally show higher intercept estimates, indicating a higher baseline effect, given that these hospitals often manage more severe cases. The effect of non-invasive treatment varies significantly among hospitals that may hinted at different standard of protocol.  Hospitals lacking cardiac specialists and opting for non-invasive treatments show higher mortality rates with longer admission durations among post-MI patients.
