# Description
This repository analyzes factors influencing the length of hospital stay among patients receiving carbapenem therapy for multidrug-resistant infections in northern Peninsular Malaysia. The study uses a multilevel linear mixed model to account for hospital-level variations.

# Dataset
This is a simulated dataset for teaching purposes. It includes patient demographics, clinical factors (e.g., SOFA score, therapy type), and hospital stay duration. Each patient is linked to a hospital, allowing for hierarchical modeling.

# Methodology
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Single & Multiple Linear Regression
- Multilevel Analysis with random intercept and slope models
- Tabulation and visualization

# Reproducibility
Code is written in R using lme4, broom.mixed, and gtsummary.

Run linear mixed model.qmd to reproduce the analysis.
